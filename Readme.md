# Statscore recruitment task sandbox

Use this repository to complete 3 designed tasks - you'll find them in `apps/web` project.

To run the web app navigate to `apps/web` and type `npm run dev` - ofc you have to `npm i` in the root directory. To start the backend, do the same - for `backend` directory ofc.

From now on, you are the owner of this repo - you can do whatever you want - including installing new packages, editing packages config `scripts` section etc.

Good luck!

## Attention
In my IntelliJ setup there seems to be an issue with running tests with "npm run test:unit", I hope with VSCode and Volar it will work but in case it does not, please try running each test suite separately.
Apologies for the inconvenience.

## Task 1
-Add unit tests for fetching people data, add axios package
-Add unit tests for /people endpoint
-Implement functionality for fetching people data and fix CORS issue
